# EnvInject Teamcity Plugin

An EnvInject plugin for Teamcity. The inspiration is from https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/EnvInject+Plugin. Basically there will be teams/companies that have their environment variables in some properties files which should be initialised on Builds. This plugin provides a runner for this purpose
